          "Bangladesh was born because of her people’s profound belief in
          liberalism, pluralism, secularism. Decades later, our ‘Generation Z’
          is making us re-visit and re-imagine the very values that our people
          Bangladesh stood for back in 1971. As our people also did in 1952, to
          defend our mother language, Bangla. We believe, the ‘monsoon
          revolution’ that the world witnessed in Bangladesh in the span of few
          weeks, may inspire many across communities and countries, to stand for
          freedom and justice. I would call upon the international community to
          engage with ‘new Bangladesh’ anew that aims to realize freedom and
          democracy, beyond letters, for everyone. "
